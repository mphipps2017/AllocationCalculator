A project I made for helping me handle my personal investing portfolio allocations.
Developed as it will save me some time every month when I go to rebalance my portfolio for regular market changes
and for new contributions.

The project takes in 2 csv files.  One is a file of target allocations for different tickers in your portfolio
where as the other is the current portfolio allocations of these tickers.

Using these 2 data points, and some current market data, it makes it easier to help see at a glance what securities
are under / over allocated to as well as create a list of transactions to remediate these differences.
